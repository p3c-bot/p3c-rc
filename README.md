# Want to create a fork with a permanent Masternode?
A Masternode entitles you to 33% of the 10% community fee on buying/selling/reinvesting. You can create a **custom** branded site that funnels all ETC through your Masternode.

1. Fork this repository.

# Development tips
- I use http://remix.ethereum.org/ to deploy smart contracts
- ETC only uses 0.4.21 or below compilers.
- For a dapp fork, Copy and paste source code into Remix and then deploy.

For frontend:
- Use [farmer.html](p3c.io/farmer.html) as a template with jquery, very simple but works.
- Use [Farm](https://github.com/p3c-bot/p3c-bot.github.io/blob/master/lib/farmer.js) to understand how to connect web3 with javascript
